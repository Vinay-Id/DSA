// Example 1:
// Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// - "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
// - "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
// - "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
// - "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
// 3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
// Example 2:
// Input: patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// - "a" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
// - "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
// - "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
// 2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
